  <p id="tribute-info">My wife was born in 1976 in Missouri. Fun fact: although born in Missouri, she never lived there. The first part of her childhood was actually spent in Chase, Kansas. Chase is a small town in eastern Kansas with only a few hundred people in it. Any town that my wife comes from must be a great place.</p>
